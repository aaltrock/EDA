## Motivation
In financial services, decisions are made typically based on high dimensional data, e.g. decisions on loans or credit scores.  In the audit context, it is difficult to identify errors in both the features as input and decisions made by financial models made with numerous features and large sampling population.  An approach is warranted in helping to identify potential outliers to assist auditors in identifying potential errors.
