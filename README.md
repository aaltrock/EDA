# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Motivation
In financial services, decisions are made typically based on high dimensional data that are a mix of categorical and numerical variables over a large population, e.g. decisions on loans or credit scores.  In the audit context, it is difficult for auditors to understand data of this nature manually and to identify potential errors in both the features as input and decisions made by financial models.  Furthermore, data of this domain often requires analysing over multiple variables concurrently to gain an adequate understanding of a given financial process.  A more automated approach is warranted in facilitating EDA, particularly over multiple variables collectively.
